## 🌈 Code of Conduct

Be kind, respectful, and constructive in all interactions. We're all here to learn and build something great together!

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Read the [Local Development Guide](./LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md)** - Set up your environment first
2. **Check the [Issue Tracker](../../issues)** - Find something to work on
3. **Ask questions** - Don't be shy! We're here to help

### Finding Something to Work On

- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` - perfect for beginners!
- Issues labeled `help wanted` - we'd love your help on these
- Have an idea? Create an issue to discuss it first!

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### 1. Fork & Clone (First Time Only)

If you're an external contributor:

```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub first, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ShareSkippy.git
cd ShareSkippy
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ShareSkippy.git
```

If you're a team member, just clone directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/ShareSkippy.git
cd ShareSkippy
```

### 2. Create a Branch

**Always** create a new branch for your work:

```bash
# Make sure you're on main and it's up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create a new branch with a descriptive name
git checkout -b feature/add-dark-mode
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**

- `feature/description` - for new features
- `fix/description` - for bug fixes
- `docs/description` - for documentation
- `refactor/description` - for code refactoring
- `test/description` - for adding tests

**Examples:**

- `feature/user-profile-page`
- `fix/login-button-alignment`
- `docs/update-readme`
- `test/add-header-tests`

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow our [Coding Standards](#coding-standards)
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation if needed

### 4. Test Your Changes

Before committing, **always** run:

```bash
# Run all quality checks
npm run validate
```

This runs:

- ✅ Prettier (code formatting)
- ✅ ESLint (code quality)
- ✅ TypeScript (type checking)
- ✅ Jest (tests)

**All checks must pass** before you can create a PR!

### 5. Commit Your Changes

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with a clear message (see commit guidelines below)
git commit -m "feat: add dark mode toggle"
```

**Note:** Pre-commit hooks will automatically run linting and formatting!

### 6. Push and Create a Pull Request

```bash
# Push your branch to GitHub
git push origin feature/add-dark-mode
```

Then on GitHub:

1. Click "Compare & pull request"
2. Fill out the PR template
3. Link any related issues
4. Request a review

## 📝 Coding Standards

### General Principles

1. **Write code for humans** - Code is read more than it's written
2. **Keep it simple** - Simple code is better than clever code
3. **Be consistent** - Follow the patterns you see in the codebase
4. **Comment when necessary** - Explain "why", not "what"

### JavaScript/TypeScript Style

We use ESLint and Prettier to enforce style automatically. Key points:

```javascript
// ✅ Good: Clear, descriptive names
const getUserProfile = async (userId) => {
  const profile = await fetchProfile(userId);
  return profile;
};

// ❌ Bad: Unclear abbreviations
const getUP = async (uid) => {
  const p = await fP(uid);
  return p;
};

// ✅ Good: Use TypeScript types
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

// ✅ Good: Destructure props
const UserCard = ({ name, email }) => {
  return <div>...</div>;
};

// ❌ Bad: Using props object directly
const UserCard = (props) => {
  return <div>{props.name}</div>;
};
```

### React Component Guidelines

```javascript
// ✅ Good: Component structure
import { useState } from 'react';

/**
 * UserProfile displays user information and allows editing
 * @param {Object} props
 * @param {User} props.user - The user to display
 * @param {Function} props.onUpdate - Callback when profile is updated
 */
const UserProfile = ({ user, onUpdate }) => {
  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);

  const handleSave = async () => {
    // Implementation...
  };

  return <div>{/* Component content */}</div>;
};

export default UserProfile;
```

### File Naming

- Components: `PascalCase.js` (e.g., `UserProfile.js`)
- Utilities: `camelCase.js` (e.g., `formatDate.js`)
- Tests: `ComponentName.test.js` (e.g., `UserProfile.test.js`)
- Hooks: `useCamelCase.js` (e.g., `useAuth.js`)

### Folder Structure

```
app/              # Next.js pages and routes
components/       # Reusable React components
  ├── ui/        # Generic UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
  └── ...        # Feature-specific components
hooks/           # Custom React hooks
lib/             # TypeScript utilities
libs/            # JavaScript utilities and services
  ├── supabase/  # Supabase client and utilities
  ├── email/     # Email sending logic
  └── ...
contexts/        # React contexts
__tests__/       # Test files
```

## 💬 Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clear commit history:

### Format

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types

- `feat:` - A new feature
- `fix:` - A bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring (no feature change or bug fix)
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks (dependencies, config, etc.)
- `perf:` - Performance improvements

### Examples

```bash
# Good commits
feat: add user profile editing
fix: resolve login redirect loop
docs: update API documentation
test: add tests for user authentication
refactor: simplify email sending logic
chore: update dependencies

# Commits with scope
feat(auth): add password reset functionality
fix(ui): correct button alignment on mobile
test(api): add integration tests for user endpoints

# Commit with body
feat: add dark mode support

Implemented dark mode toggle in settings page.
Uses system preference as default. Persists user
preference in local storage.

Closes #123
```

### Breaking Changes

If your change breaks existing functionality:

```bash
feat!: change API response structure

BREAKING CHANGE: User API now returns nested profile object
instead of flat structure. Update client code accordingly.
```

## 🔍 Pull Request Process

### Before Creating a PR

- ✅ All tests pass: `npm test`
- ✅ Code is formatted: `npm run format`
- ✅ No lint errors: `npm run lint`
- ✅ Types check: `npm run typecheck`

### After Approval

Once approved:

1. Make sure your branch is up to date with main
2. Squash commits if requested
3. The maintainer will merge your PR

## 🧪 Testing

### Writing Tests

Every feature should have tests. We use Jest and React Testing Library.

```javascript
// __tests__/components/Button.test.js
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import Button from '@/components/Button';

describe('Button', () => {
  it('renders with correct text', () => {
    render(<Button>Click me</Button>);
    expect(screen.getByText('Click me')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('calls onClick when clicked', () => {
    const handleClick = jest.fn();
    render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>);

    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Click me'));
    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  });

  it('is disabled when disabled prop is true', () => {
    render(<Button disabled>Click me</Button>);
    expect(screen.getByText('Click me')).toBeDisabled();
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (great for TDD!)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run a specific test file
npm test Button.test.js
```

### Test Coverage

We aim for:

- **80%+** line coverage for new code
- **100%** coverage for critical paths (auth, payments, etc.)
